Hello, I’m @lucasrfma

Thanks for checking out my github profile! I hope you are having a good day =)

I am working at Instituto Atlântico as a java developer using spring boot to create microsservices.

A quick summary of my current skills:
- The programming language I am currently most comfortable with is Java, but I have also studied C++, Javascript, C#, Python, C, and recently Dart(Flutter).
- I have used basic .NET features for creating CRUD API's in C# for some courses.
- Although frontend is not my focus, I have studied html and CSS.
- I have studied SQL databases, mostly using PostgreSQL. As for non SQL databases, I have a very basic knowledge of MongoDB.
