Hello, I’m @lucasrfma

Thanks for checking out my github profile! I hope you are having a good day =)

I am working at Instituto Atlântico as a java developer using spring boot to create micro-services.

A quick summary of my current skills:
- I have worked mostly with back-end with Java + Spring boot
- Although I have less experience with front-end, I have studied and worked a bit with Angular, as well as Salesforce's LWC
- I have been using MongoDB extensively in my current job, as some rather complex Aggregations are needed sometimes

- Other technologies I am familiar with via studies are:
  - I am currently working on a personal project with Flutter. It's the Interval Training Timer repo
  - Dart/Flutter, Rust, C++, C#, C, Python
  - SQL (PostgreSQL)
