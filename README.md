- Hi, I’m @lucasrfma
- I’m interested in getting a job! Preferrebly an entry level coding job.
- I have studied C, Java, Python and C++
- I am continuing to study C++ and Java for now, and will probably start some sort of project using one of them for my portfolio when done with the courses I am going through currently.
- That said, I have heard C# and .Net are good languages to get a job so I need to start learning them too...
